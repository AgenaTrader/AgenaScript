#Handling bars and instruments

Data is understood as information that is retrieved externally and uploaded to AgenaTrader, or as data series that are created by AgenaScripts.

Further detailed information can be found using the appropriate shortcuts:

[Bars (Candles)](#bars-candles)

[Data series](#data-series)

[Instruments](#instruments)

##Bars (Candles)
### Functionality
A classical indicator calculates one or multiple values using an existing data series.

Data series can be anything from closing prices to daily lows or values of an hourly period etc.

Every period (meaning all candles of one day, one hour etc.) is assigned one or more indicator values.
The following example is based on an indicator value, such as with a moving average, for example.
To calculate a smoothed moving average, AgenaTrader needs a data series. In this example we will use the closing prices. All closing prices of a bar (candle) that are represented in the chart will be saved in a list and indexed.

The current closing price, meaning the closing price of the bar that is on the right-hand side of the chart, will be assigned an index of 0. The bar to the left of that will have an index of 1 and so on. The oldest bar displayed will have an index value of 500.

Whenever a new bar is added within a session it will become the new index 0; the bar to the left of it, which previously had an index of 0, will become index 1 and so on. The oldest bar will become index 501.
Within a script (a self-created program/algorithm) the [***Close***] will be representative for the array (list) of all closing prices.
The last closing price is thus *Close \[0\]*; the closing price previous to this will become *Close \[1\]*, the value before that will become *Close \[2\]* and the oldest bar will be *Close \[501\]*. The number within the squared brackets represents the index. AgenaTrader allows you to use the „bars ago“ expression for this in general cases.

Obviously, every bar will not only have a closing value but also a [*High*](#high), [*Low*](#low), [*Open*](#open), [*Median*](#median), [*Typical*](#typical), [*Weighted*](#weighted), [*Time*](#time) and [*Volume*](#volume). Thus, the high of the candle that occurred 10 days ago will be *High \[10\]*, yesterday’s low *Low \[1\]*...

**Important tip:**

The previous examples all assume that the calculations will occur at the end of a period. The value of the currently running index is not being taken into consideration.

If you wish to use the values of the currently forming candle then you will need to set the value of

[*CalculateOnBarClose*] to „false“.

In this case the currently running bar will have the value 0, the bar next to the current bar will have the value 1 and so on. The oldest bar (as in the example above) would now have the value 502.

With close \[0\] you would receive the most recent value of the last price that your data provider transmitted to AgenaTrader. All values of the bar (high \[0\], low \[0\]…) may still change as long as the bar is not yet finished/closed and a new bar has not yet started. Only the open \[0\] value will not change.

## Properties of Bars
### Properties of Bars
"Bars" represents a list of all bars (candles) within a chart (see [*Functionality*][*Bars*]).

Bars (**public** IBars Bars) can be used directly in a script and equates to BarsArray \[0\] (see Bars.GetNextBeginEnd for more information).

The list of bars itself has many properties that can be used in AgenaScript. Properties are always indicated by a dot before the objects (in this case bars, list of candles).

With the **OnBarUpdate()** method you can use any properties you want without having to test for a null reference.
As soon as the function **OnBarUpdate()** is called up by AgenaScript, it is assumed that an object is also available. If you wish to use these properties outside of **OnBarUpdate()** then you should first perform a test for null references using **if** (Bars != **null**).

## BarsSinceSession
### Description
Bars.BarsSinceSession outputs the amount of bars that have occurred since the beginning of the current trading session.

See further [*Properties*] of bars.

### Return Value
Type int Amount of Bars

A value of -1 indicates a problem with referencing the correct session beginning.

### Usage
Bars.BarsSinceSession

### Further Information
Within *OnBarUpdate()* this property can be used without having to test for a null reference. As soon as the OnBarUpdate() method is called up by AgenaScript, the object will become available.

If this property is used outside of OnBarUpdate() then you should test for a null reference before executing it. You can test using *if* (Bars!= *null*) .

### Example
```cs
Print ("Since the start of the last trading session there have been” + Bars.BarsSinceSession + “bars.");
```

## Bars.Count
### Description
Bars.Count gives you the amount of bars in a data series.

See [*Properties*] for additional information.

### Return Value
Type int Amount of Bars

### Usage
Bars.Count

### More Information
The value of *CurrentBar* can only be lesser than or equal to Bars.Count - 1

When you specify how many bars are to be loaded within AgenaTrader, then the value of Bars.Count is equal to this setting. In the following example, Bars.Count would give back a value of 500.

<img src="./media/image1.png" width="296" height="363" />

### Example
```cs
Print ("There are a total of” + Bars.Count + “bars available.");
```

## Bars.FirstBarOfSession
### Description
With Bars.FirstBarOfSession you can determine whether the current bar is the first bar of the trading session.

See [*Properties*] of bars for more information.

**false**: The bar is not the first bar of the current trading session

### Usage
Bars.FirstBarOfSession

### More Information
With *OnBarUpdate()* this property can be used without having to test for a null reference. As soon as the OnBarUpdate() method is called up, an object will become available.
If this property is called up outside of OnBarUpdate() you should test for a null reference using if (Bars != null).

### Example
```cs
if (Bars.FirstBarOfSession)
Print ("The current trading session started at” + Time [0]);
```

DateTime session end

**Note:**
The date for the beginning and the end of a trading session are connected components. If the specified date corresponds to the end date of the current trading session then the returned value for the beginning of a trading session may already be in the past. In this case the date for the following trading session cannot be returned.

### Usage
```cs
Bars.GetNextBeginEnd(Bars bars, int barsAgo, out DateTime sessionBegin, out DateTime sessionEnd)
Bars.GetNextBeginEnd(DateTime time, out DateTime sessionBegin, out DateTime sessionEnd)

### More Information
The two signatures will not necessarily output the same result.
When using the bar signature, the supplied bar will be inspected for its session template association. The beginning and end of the next session will be taken from this template.

When using the time signature, the date and time of the supplied bar will be used to calculate the data for the current and the following sessions.

When using the time signature, a timestamp is transmitted that corresponds exactly to the beginning or the end time of a session.

More information can be found here [*http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.datetime.aspx*]

### Example
```cs
DateTime sessionBegin;
DateTime sessionEnd;
protected override void OnBarUpdate()
{
Bars.GetNextBeginEnd(Bars, 0, out sessionBegin, out sessionEnd);
Print("Session Start: " + sessionBegin + " Session End: " + sessionEnd);
}
```

## Bars.GetSessionDate
### Description
Bars.GetSessionDate provides the date and the time of the start of a particular trading session.

The date and time for the start of the current trading session are also displayed correctly even if the function is used on a bar in the past.

## Bars.GetOpen
### Description
For reasons of compatibility, the following methods are available.

- Bars.GetOpen(int index) outputs the open for the bars referenced with &lt;index&gt;.
- Bars.GetHigh(int index) outputs the high for the bars referenced with &lt;index&gt;.
- Bars.GetLow(int index) outputs the low for the bars referenced with &lt;index&gt;.
- Bars.GetClose(int index) outputs the close for the bars referenced with &lt;index&gt;.
- Bars.GetTime(int index) outputs the timestamp for the bars referenced with &lt;index&gt;.
- Bars.GetVolume(int index) outputs the volume for the bars referenced with &lt;index&gt;.

**Caution**: The indexing will deviate from the [*Indexing*][*Bars*] normally used.
Here, the indexing will begin with 0 for the oldest bar (on the left of the chart) and end with the newest bar on the right of the chart (=Bars.Count-1).

The indexing can easily be recalculated:
```cs
private int Convert(int idx)
{
return Math.Max(0,Bars.Count-idx-1-(CalculateOnBarClose?1:0));
}
```

### Parameter
int index (0 .. Bars.Count-1)

##Instruments
The term "instrument" denotes a tradable value such as a stock, ETF, future etc.

An instrument has various properties that can be used in AgenaScripts created by the user:

[*Instrument.Compare*](#instrumentcompare)

[*Instrument.Currency*](#instrumentcurrency)

[*Instrument.Digits*](#instrumentdigits)

[*Instrument.ETF*](#instrumentetf)

[*Instrument.Exchange*](#instrumentexchange)

[*Instrument.Expiry*](#instrumentexpiry)

**Tick Value**

The tick value can be calculated by multiplying the point value with the tick size.

For example, the E-mini S&P 500 has a point value of $50. The tick size equals 0.25. This means that there are 4 ticks in one full point for the E-mini S&P 500.
Since 50 * 0.25 = 50/4 this means that the tick value is $12.50.

The point value can also be viewed within the Instrument Escort:

<img src="./media/image8.png" width="564" height="409" />

### Example
```cs
Print("When " + Instrument.Name + " rises for one full point then this is equal to " + Instrument.PointValue + " " + Instrument.Currency);
```

```

### More Information
The number of decimal places to which the price is rounded depends on the instrument.
If, for example, an instrument is a stock, then the rounding will be performed to 2 decimal places. For a Forex instrument, it may be carried out to 4 or 5 decimal places.

See [*TickSize*] and [*Instrument.Digits*].

Example of professional [*Formatting*][*Formatting of Numbers*].

### Example

The index for DrawObjects is the explicit name for the drawing object (string tag).

### Usage
DrawObjects \[string tag\]

### Example
**Note:** To be able to use the interface definitions you must use the using method.
```cs
using AgenaTrader.Plugins;
// Output number of drawing objects within the chart and their tags
Print("The chart contains " + DrawObjects.Count + " drawing objects.");
for each (IDrawObject draw in DrawObjects) Print(draw.Tag);
//Draw a black trend line...
DrawLine("MyLine", true, 10, Close[10], 0, Close[0], Color.Black, DashStyle.Solid, 3);
// ... and change the color to red
ITrendLine line = (ITrendLine) DrawObjects["MyLine"];
if (line != null) line.Pen.Color = Color.Red;
// Set all lines within the chart to a line strength of 3,
// and lock it so that it cannot be edited or moved
foreach (IDrawObject draw in DrawObjects)
if (draw is IVerticalLine)
{
IVerticalLine vline = (IVerticalLine) draw;
vline.Locked = true;
vline.Editable = false;
vline.Pen.Width = 3;
}
```

## Input
### Description
Input is a [*DataSeries*] object in which the input data for an indicator or strategy is stored.

If the indicator is used without any explicit instructions for the input data, then the closing price for the current market prices will be used.

When calling up the SMA(20) the smoothing average is calculated on the basis of the closing prices for the current chart price data (this is equivalent to SMA(close,20).

Input\[0\] = Close\[0\].

When calling up the SMA(high, 20) the high price values are loaded and used for the calculation of the smoothing average.

Input\[0\] = High\[0\].

This way you can select which data series should be used for the calculation of the indicator.

**double** d = **RSI**(**SMA**(20), 14, 3)\[0\]; calculates the 14 period RSI using the SMA(20) as the input data series.
Input\[0\] = SMA(20)\[0\].

### Usage
```cs
Input
Input[int barsAgo]
```

### Example
```cs
Print("The input data for the indicators are " + Input[0]);
```

## Lines
### Description
Lines is a collection that contains all [*Line*] objects of an indicator.

When a line object is added to the indicator using the [*Add()*] method, this line is automatically added to the “lines” collection.

The order of the add commands determines how these lines are sorted. The first information request of Add() will create Lines\[0\], the next information request will be Lines\[1\] etc.

See [*Plots*].

### Usage
```cs
Lines[int index]
```

### Example
```cs
// Add "using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;" for DashStyle
protected override void Initialize()
{
Add(new Line(Color.Blue, 70, "Upper")); // saves into Lines[0]
Add(new Line(Color.Blue, 30, "Lower")); // saves into Lines[1]
}
protected override void OnBarUpdate()
{
// When the RSI is above 70, properties of the lines will be changed
if (RSI(14 ,3) >= 70)
{
Lines[0].Width = 3;
Lines[0].Color = Color.Red;
Lines[0].DashStyle = DashStyle.Dot;
}
else
{
Lines[0].Width = 1;
Lines[0].Color = Color.Blue;
Lines[0].DashStyle = DashStyle.Solid;
}
}
```

## PlotColors
### Description
PlotColors is a collection that contains all color series of all plot objects.

When a plot is added using the [*Add()*] method it automatically creates a color series object and is added to the PlotColors collection.

The order of the add commands determines how the plot colors are sorted. The first information request of Add() will create PlotColors\[0\], the following information request will create PlotColors\[1\] etc.

### Usage
```cs
PlotColors[int PlotIndex][int barsAgo]
```

}
}
}
}
```

## Plots
### Description
Plots is a collection that contains the plot objects of an indicator.

When a plot object is added to an indicator using the Add() method, it is also automatically added to the “plots” collection.

The order of the add commands determines how the plots are sorted. The first Add() information request will create Plots\[0\], the following information request will create Plots\[1\] etc.

See [*Lines*].

### Usage
```cs
Plots[int index]
```

### Example
```cs
protected override void Initialize()
{
Add(new Plot(Color.Blue, "MySMA 20")); // saved to Plots[0]
}
protected override void OnBarUpdate()
{
Value.Set(SMA(20)[0]);
// If the market price is above the SMA colorize it green, otherwise red
if (Close[0] > SMA(20)[0])
	Plots[0].PlotColor = Color.Green;
else
	Plots[0].PlotColor = Color.Red;
}
```

## Values
### Description
Values is a collection that contains the data series objects of an indicator.

When a plot is added to an indicator using the Add() method, a value object is automatically created and added to the “values” collection.

The order of the add commands determines how the values are sorted. The first information request will create Values\[0\], the next information request will create Values\[1\] etc.

**Value** is always identical to Values\[0\].

### Usage
```cs
Values[int index]
Values[int index][int barsAgo]
```

### More Information
The methods known for a collection, Set() Reset() and Count(), are applicable for values.

Information on the class collection:
[*http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ybcx56wz%28v=vs.80%29.aspx*]

### Example
```cs
// Check the second indicator value of one bar ago and set the value of the current indicator value based on it.
if (Values[1][1] < High[0] - Low[0])
Value.Set(High[0] - Low[0]);
else
Value.Set(High[0] - Close[0]);
```

## Multibars
### Description
An indicator or a strategy will always have the same underlying timeframe-units as those units being displayed within the chart. The values of an SMA(14) indicator displayed in a 5 minute chart will be calculated based on the last fourteen 5 minute bars. A daily chart, on the other hand, would use the closing prices of the past 14 days in order to calculate this value.
The same method applies for your self-programmed indicators. A 5 minute chart will call up the [*OnBarUpdate()*] for each 5 minute bar.
If you want your self-created indicator to use a different timeframe, this is possible using multibars.

### Example
```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Drawing;

### Additional Notes
When using additional timeframes, a further entry with the respective data series for the bars of the new timeframe will be added to the arrays [*Opens*], [*Highs*], [*Lows*], [*Closes*], [*Medians*], [*Typicals*], [*Weighteds*], [*Times*] and [*Volumes*]. The indexing will occur in the order of the addition of the new timeframes.
Closes\[0\]\[0\] is equivalent to Close\[0\].
Closes\[1\]\[0\] equals the current closing price for the daily data series
Closes\[2\]\[0\] equals the current closing price for the weekly data series

"Closes" is, of course, interchangeable with Opens, Highs, Lows etc.

See [*CurrentBars*], [*BarsInProgress*], [*TimeFrames*], [*TimeFrameRequirements*].

Additional syntax methods are available for multibars:
```cs
// Declare the variable TF_DAY and define it
private static readonly TimeFrame TF_Day = new TimeFrame(DatafeedHistoryPeriodicity.Day, 1);
private static readonly TimeFrame TF_Week = new TimeFrame(DatafeedHistoryPeriodicity.Week, 1);
// The following instruction is identical to double d = Closes[1][0];
double d = MultiBars.GetBarsItem(TF_Day).Close[0];
// The following instruction is identical to double w = Closes[2][0];
double w = MultiBars.GetBarsItem(TF_Week).Close[0];
```

## CurrentBars
### Description
CurrentBars is an array of int values that contains the number of *[CurrentBar]s* for each bar.

This array is only of value for indicators or strategies that use data from multiple timeframes.

A new entry is added to the array whenever a new timeframe is added to an indicator or strategy.

With **\[TimeFrameRequirements(("1 Day"), ("1 Week"))\]** the array will contain 3 entries:

CurrentBars\[0\] Current bar for the primary data series (chart timeframe)
CurrentBars\[1\] Current bar for the daily bars
CurrentBars\[2\] Current bar for the weekly bars

CurrentBars\[0\] is equivalent to [*CurrentBar*][CurrentBar].

Also see [*MultiBars*].

### Parameter
barSeriesIndex Index value for the various timeframes

### Usage
```cs
CurrentBars[int barSeriesIndex]
```

### Example
```cs
//Ensure that a minimum of 20 bars is loaded
for (int i=0; i<CurrentBars.Count; i++)
if (CurrentBars[i] < 20) return;
```

## BarsInProgress
### Description
Within a multibars script, multiple bars objects are available. The OnBarUpdate() method
will therefore also be called up for every bar within your script. In order to include/exclude events of specific data series, you can use the BarsInProgress method.

BarsInProgress is only of value for indicators or strategies that use data from multiple timeframes.
With **\[TimeFrameRequirements("1 Day", "1 Week")\]** two timeframes will be added to the primary chart timeframe.

If OnBarUpdate() is called up by the primary data series, then BarsInProgress will equal zero. If OnBarUpdate() is called up by the daily bars, then BarsInProgress will equal 1. Weekly bars will have a value of 2.

See [*Multibars*][*MultiBars*] and [*CurrentBars*].

### Parameter
none

### Usage
BarsInProgress

### More Information
Within a script that only works with primary timeframes, the value will always equal zero.

### Example
```cs
// To demonstrate the methodology
// set CalculateOnBarClose=false
Print(Time[0] + " " + BarsInProgress);
// Calculate only for the chart timeframe
protected override void OnBarUpdate()
{
if (BarsInProgress > 0) return;
// Logic for the primary data series
}
```

## TimeFrames
### Description
TimeFrames is an array of timeframe objects that contains a timeframe object for each individual bar object.

This array is only of value for indicators or strategies that use data from multiple timeframes.

A new entry is added to the array whenever a new timeframe is added to an indicator or strategy.

With **\[TimeFrameRequirements(("1 Day"), ("1 Week"))\]** the array will contain 3 entries:

TimeFrames \[0\] Timeframe of the primary data series (chart timeframe)
TimeFrames \[1\] **Print**(TimeFrames\[1\]); // returns "1 Day"
TimeFrames \[2\] **Print**(TimeFrames\[2\]); // returns "1 Week"

TimeFrames \[0\] is equivalent to [*TimeFrame*].

See [*MultiBars*].

### Parameter
barSeriesIndex Index value for the various timeframes

### Usage
```cs
TimeFrames [int barSeriesIndex]
```

### Example
```cs
if (BarsInProgress == 0 && CurrentBar == 0)
for (int i = BarsArray.Count-1; i >= 0; i--)
Print("The Indicator " + this.Name + " uses Bars of the Timeframe " + TimeFrames[i]);
```
